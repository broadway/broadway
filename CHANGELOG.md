## v1.0.x

#### BC breaks

- The EventStore interface added a `loadFromPlayhead` method
- The ReadModelTestCase is renamed to SerializableReadModelTestCase
- We moved the Doctrine DBAL event store implementation to a [separate repository](https://github.com/broadway/event-store-dbal)
- We moved the Elasticsearch read model implementation to a [separate repository](https://github.com/broadway/read-model-elasticsearch) 
- We moved the Symfony bundle to a [separate repository](https://github.com/broadway/broadway-bundle)
- We moved the Saga component to a [separate repository](https://github.com/broadway/broadway-saga)
- DBALEventStore and InMemoryEventStore can now throw DuplicatePlayheadException.
  Ensure you are catching EventStoreException instead of specific driver exceptions.

## v0.10.x

- added the ReflectionAggregateFactory as an alternative to the NamedConstructorAggregateFactory
- specify ReadModel type searching Elasticsearch read model repository
- added PHPUnit as a development dependency

#### Other changes

- The Symfony Bundle is now Symfony 3 compatible
- The DBALEventStore can now be disabled in configuration

## v0.8.x

#### BC breaks

#### Other changes

- Support for [querying the event store](https://github.com/qandidate-labs/broadway/commit/e81d4ea167ce97383a9a4b7d85542e8b5e11900a) using criteria
- The `COMMAND_FAILURE` event now receives [an associative array](https://github.com/qandidate-labs/broadway/blob/140d23f90259bace9601b17ebf749317cd859180/src/Broadway/CommandHandling/EventDispatchingCommandBus.php#L48) when it gets dispatched.
- Fixed a locale issue with creating DateTime objects.

## v0.7.x

#### Symfony Bundle

- You can now configure which Doctrine DBAL connection should be used for the event store
- The auditing command logger service now only gets registered when it's explicitly enabled
- You can now register Sagas with the tag `broadway.saga`
- The `broadway:event-store:schema:drop` command no longer errors when there is no schema

##### Other changes

- The DBALEventStore now also works with mysqli

## v0.6.x

- The Scenario for CommandHandling now clears the recorded events after each `then`. So for each then you only need to supply the **newly** recorded events.

## v0.5.x

#### BC breaks

- DomainMessageInterface has been removed, and DomainMessage has been made final.
- Renamed `add` method to `save` for [aggregate root repositories](https://github.com/mbadolato/broadway/commit/9b07dfc4998d70b4c6d25dcacf114a60ea7f1450).

## v0.4.x

#### BC breaks

- Updated `beberlei/assert` requirement to 2.0.

## v0.3.0

#### BC breaks

- The AggregateFactory is a new required constructor argument for a EventSourcingRepository and the order of the arguments changed.
