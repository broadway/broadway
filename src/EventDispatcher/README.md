Event Dispatcher Component
==========================

Event dispatcher component providing event dispatchers to your application.

The component provides an event dispatcher interface and a simple
implementation. In the future it would be great to have integrations with other
implementations.

## Example

The [`examples/`][examples] directory at the root of the project contains a
runnable event dispatcher example (`event-dispatcher`). The code you find there
contains comments with what is happening.
