Event Handling Component
========================

Provides event bus and event listeners abstractions.

The component provides interfaces for an event bus and event listeners, but
also an implementation of a simple event bus and an event bus that will record
published events (useful for testing).

## Example

The [`examples/`][examples] directory at the root of the project contains a
runnable event handling example (`event-handling`). The code you find there
contains comments with what is happening.
