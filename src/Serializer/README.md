Serializer Component
====================

Serializer component provides serializers to your application.

The component provides a simple serializer interface and a serializer
implementation based on "handwritten" serializers. In the future it would be
great to have support for more broadly used serializer implementations.

## Example

The [`examples/`][examples] directory at the root of the project contains a
runnable serializer example (`serializer`). The code you find there
contains comments with what is happening.

[examples]: ../../../examples/
