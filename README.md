Broadway
========

Broadway is a project providing infrastructure and testing helpers for creating
CQRS and event sourced applications. Broadway tries hard to not get in your
way. The project contains several loosely coupled components that can be used
together to provide a full CQRS\ES experience.

> Note: while broadway is currently used in production, you should probably
> know what you're doing. ;)
